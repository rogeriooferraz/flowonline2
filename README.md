> **About this fork**
>
> This repository is a fork of [PiBOH/flowonline2](https://github.com/PiBOH/flowonline2).
>
> It is maintained to preserve upstream compatibility while enabling the minimal
> application changes required for an installable PWA-style desktop experience,
> with Linux as a primary target.
>
> Project-specific planning, validation, deployment, packaging, and
> infrastructure are intentionally maintained outside this source repository to
> keep the fork as close to upstream as practical.
>
> Changes made here should remain as close as practical to upstream so the fork
> stays easy to synchronize, review, rebase, and contribute back.

## 🌟 Key Features & Emulation Highlights

### 1. Faithful Win32 & MDI Visuals
*   **Aero Glass Title Bar:** Emulates the classic Windows title bar, featuring the 4-box colored Flowgorithm logo and decorative system controls.
*   **Docked Multiple Document Interface (MDI):** Real-time workspace split layouts including *Flowchart Only* (🖥️), *Flowchart & Watch* (📊), *Flowchart & Console* (💬), *Triple Split View* (🚀, default), and *Flowchart & Source Code* (📝).
*   **6 Official Color Themes:** Cycle between *Classic*, *Pastel*, *Vibrant*, *Retro*, *Twilight (Dark Theme)*, and *Black & White* to dynamically recolor the canvas nodes, Watch spreadsheet, and Console messages simultaneously.

### 2. Premium Editing & Interaction (v2.0.13)
*   **Multiple Block Selection:** Select blocks with a single click, or hold down `Ctrl` / `Shift` / `Cmd` to select multiple blocks together! Selected shapes get a beautiful, glowing blue dotted outline.
*   **Win32 Context Menu (Tasto Destro):** Right-click on any block or circular blue inserter pin (`+`) to open a classic Windows contextual popup menu. Options include:
    *   `📝 Modifica... (Edit...)`
    *   `✂️ Taglia (Cut)`
    *   `📋 Copia (Copy)`
    *   `📥 Incolla dopo / Incolla Blocco (Paste After / Paste Block)`
    *   `❌ Elimina (Delete)`
*   **Keyboard Deletion and Clipboard:** Fully supports keyboard actions: press `Delete` or `Backspace` to delete all selected blocks at once, or use `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+X`, and `Ctrl+V` to copy, cut, and paste blocks with anti-collision ID regeneration.
*   **In-App MANUAL.md Viewer:** Includes a spacious `800x600px` manual window that dynamically fetches and renders this markdown formatted file with beautiful titles, styled operator tables, and clickable language anchors.

### 3. High-Fidelity Interpreter & VM
*   **Step-by-Step Debugger:** Compiles AST statements into flat VM instructions, smoothly auto-centering active nodes inside the viewport during execution.
*   **Case-Insensitive Variable Names:** Case-insensitive variable lookup and expression handling.
*   **String & Character Conversion Intrinsics:** Full support for `Char`, `ToCode`, `ToChar`, `ToInteger`, `ToReal`, `ToString`, `Int`, `Sgn`, standard trig functions, and comparative string comparisons.
*   **Unquoted Newline Constant (`\n`):** Parse unquoted `\n` inside string concatenations (e.g., `text & \n & "more text"`).

### 4. Seamless File Bidirectionality
*   **FPRG XML (.fprg):** On load, parses the XML tree, preserving comments and converting `ToChar(13)` to unquoted `\n`. On save, writes standardized XML, translating `\n` back to `ToChar(13)` and preserving strict scalar types (preventing variables from becoming arrays in desktop Flowgorithm - Issue #1).
*   **JSON Backups (.json):** Export and reload raw backup JSON states directly using the Open button or the toolbar.
